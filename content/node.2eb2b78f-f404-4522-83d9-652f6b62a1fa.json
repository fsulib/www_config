            "value": "<p>Florida State University Libraries Special Collections & Archives is pleased to announce that it will award research grants of up to $1500 each to non-FSU graduate students, post docs, early career scholars, and\/or independent researchers to support research in our collections.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Harper Research Grant provides support for research in any collection managed by FSU Libraries Special Collections & Archives. Awards are funded by an endowment established by Dr. Kristine Harper, professor of history and philosophy of the Earth sciences at the University of Copenhagen, former Florida State University History Professor and Scholar. Dr. Harper was inspired to create this fund to pay forward the support she received as a young scholar. Dr. Harper believes that without the support of libraries, many scholars would not finish their degrees and important primary sources would be forgotten. Dr. Harper is dedicated to bringing FSU\u2019s world-class collections to a broader scholarly audience and to supporting developing scholars.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collections of unique manuscripts, historic maps, rare books, photographs, and university archives offer abundant opportunities for discovery and scholarship. Strengths of the collections include regional history from colonial times through the twentieth century, including but not limited to plantation and business records, Civil Rights, and society and culture, the French Revolution and Napoleonic Empire poetry and literature, Florida political history, and the history of Florida State University. We are also the home of the Emmett Till Archives, the Claude Pepper Library, and FSU\u2019s World War II Archives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For information on the collections held by FSU Libraries Special Collections & Archives, <a href=\"\/special-collections-and-archives\">please visit our website<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<p>Prospective applicants are encouraged to discuss their research project and the collections that might support it with Special Collections staff before submitting an application.
