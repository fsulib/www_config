Florida State University faculty and currently enrolled students may apply for the Open Access Publishing Fund by filling out an <strong><a href=\"\/teaching-and-learning\/open-access-fund-form\">Open Access Fund Proposal<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Open Research Tools<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/osf.io\/institutions\/fsu\/\">Open Science Framework<\/a> is a tool that promotes open, centralized workflows by enabling capture of different aspects and products of the research lifecycle, including developing a research idea, designing a study, storing and analyzing collected data, and writing and publishing reports or papers. Do not use this service to store or transfer personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), or any other controlled unclassified information (CUI). FSU's <a href=\"http:\/\/regulations.fsu.edu\/sites\/g\/files\/upcbnu486\/files\/policies\/research\/FSU%20Policy%207A-26.pdf\">Research Data Management Policy<\/a> applies. For assistance please contact the <a href=\"mailto:khofmahoney@fsu.edu\">FSU Libraries Open Science Librarian<\/a> (khofmahoney@fsu.edu).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Open Community of Practice<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/openscholars.github.io\/\">Open Scholars Project<\/a> is an informal monthly forum to learn about and discuss developments in open access. The group allows FSU researchers and scholars to share experiences with open publishing, open source code and open data across subject areas.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Transformative Agreements<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>New models have emerged to address publisher fees for open access. To best support authors, Florida State University Libraries signed a \u201cPublish and Read\u201d agreement with Cambridge University Press which allows the Libraries to sponsor publications by FSU affiliated authors to be freely available to all readers, through inclusion in our subscription package. The transformative agreements represent a significant breakthrough in bringing FSU\u2019s research to readers without restrictive paywalls or subscriptions and helps build new, more financially sustainable models of scholarly communication.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Florida State Open Publishing<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/publishing.lib.fsu.edu\/\">Florida State Open Publishing<\/a> provides publishing services for journals, monographs, open educational resources, and digital scholarship projects. We consult on a variety of scholarly publishing topics and digital research tools and methodologies. We aim to provide open access publishing expertise, services, and platforms to enhance the scholarly output of Florida State University students, faculty, and staff.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Open Memberships and Partnerships<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>FSU Libraries supports projects in affordable publishing, repositories, and advocacy organizations as well as publisher discount programs for article processing fees.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/\">Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)<\/a> 10% Article Processing Charge Discount Program for FSU authors publishing open access<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.openlibhums.org\/\">Open Library of the Humanities<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/open.umn.edu\/otn\/\">Open Education Network<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/doaj.org\/\">Directory of Open Access Journals<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/sparcopen.org\/who-we-are\/\">Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)<\/a><\/li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/librarypublishing.org\/get-involved\/lpc-membership\/\">Library Publishing Coalition<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n",
