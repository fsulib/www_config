The balance is due prior to installation.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Master Craftsman Studio designs, fabricates, and installs each window. MCS oversees maintenance of windows and consults on long-term preservation. $15,000 of the $50,000 is allocated for these services. An additional contingency charge of up to 33% may be paid to MCS if extraordinary expenses are incurred in production of the window. These extra costs will be absorbed by the Heritage Fund and are not the responsibility of the donor. However, the donor will be informed of any potential extra costs during the design phase.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>After Master Craftsman Studio is paid, remaining funds are deposited into one of the Heritage Museum foundation accounts, as determined by the Dean of University Libraries, to be used for long-term enhancement and preservation of the Museum.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color;padding:20px;\">\r\n\t<h2>Criteria for Windows Subject Matter<\/h2>\r\n\t<p>The limited number of window spaces remaining in Dodd Hall has required re-evaluation and narrowing of criteria for the subjects granted a window.<\/p>\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The window subject must represent a significant aspect of Florida State University heritage and have enduring historical significance to FSU.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The window subject&rsquo;s contribution to Florida State University must be verifiable and established through documentation.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Nominations of subjects which are controversial or of potential embarrassment to FSU are discouraged.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Windows are not to be used for donor recognition.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Preference will be given to representation of collective entities (groups, clubs, colleges, historical events, etc.).

This process occurs in three phases: Consultation, Design, and Fabrication. In most cases Consultation and Design occur in tandem. Fabrication begins following approval of a final design and concludes in installation.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>The Director of Master Craftsman Studio (and\/or designee) will conduct the design process with the donor in collaboration with the Dean of University Libraries (and\/or designee.)<\/p>\r\n\t<h3>Consultation Phase<\/h3>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Window design is a collaborative process that includes the client\/donor(s), staff members from Master Craftsman Studio, and representatives of University Libraries.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>This process is most efficient when no more than 2-3 individuals represent the client\/donor.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>In general, two or three face-to-face meetings are necessary. In the initial meeting, ideas for visual representation of the subject will be developed.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Another face-to-face meeting is held for the purpose of glass selection.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n\t<h3>Design Phase<\/h3>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Master Craftsman artists will develop the concept through a succession of design sketches which will be shared with the client, often via email, for feedback and discussion. Prospective designs are critiqued and refined until a final design is agreed upon by all parties.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>MCS staff time is billed by the hour. Therefore clarity, efficiency and the expression of honest opinions are highly desirable throughout the process.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The Dean of University Libraries and the Director of Master Craftsman Studio have ultimate approval over the final design and may dictate changes to the design, as needed, throughout the process.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n\t<h3>Fabrication Phase<\/h3>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>During the fabrication phase, the window is built and, when completed, installed in the Heritage Museum.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Master Craftsman Studio is responsible for fabrication, installation, and maintenance.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n\t<h3>Technical Specifications<\/h3>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>A wide variety of techniques and materials are used in the creation of windows, selected during the design and fabrication phases. Each design stands on its own and adheres to the highest standards of craftsmanship and artistic merit.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Banners are placed above all shield-shaped windows. Banners consist of text which identifies the entity represented in the window<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Banner font size should be 65 point or higher so that text can be read easily by persons viewing the window.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Banners are fabricated from Kokomo 1 glass for uniformity.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Recognition plaques identify the donor or honoree and are mounted near each section of windows.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Each plaque is 23&rdquo; by 14&rdquo;, divided into 8&rdquo; by 5&frac34; blocks.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Each block holds information on one of the stained glass windows in that section, and allows for a maximum of 130 characters.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color;padding:20px;\">\r\n\t<h2>Other Considerations<\/h2>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>The administration of the Heritage Museum&rsquo;s stained-glass windows program shall be done in concert with all appropriate University policies and procedures, including but not limited to, Florida State University Policy 8-2, naming buildings.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>When necessary and appropriate, consultations with other University committees or departments may be initiated to assist in the evaluation of window subjects, topics or themes.<\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t<p>If assistance with funding is needed, the Dean of University Libraries, the Libraries&rsquo; Director of Development, and the Heritage Museum Advisory Board will work with the donor(s) to identify potential funding sources.

The Studio may contract with colleges, departments, or others to create and install artworks elsewhere, which may represent a wider range of subjects or perspectives, as desired by the client.
