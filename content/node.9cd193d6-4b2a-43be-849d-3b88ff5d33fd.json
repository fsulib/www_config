In a recent survey, 72% of FSU students (n = 350) reported having not purchased a required textbook due to high cost. Our findings underline the impact of the textbook affordability problem on FSU students and suggest that the vast majority of our students would support broader adoption of affordable online textbooks. Our team is looking forward to continuing to advocate for change in this space, providing both students and instructors with the information and resources they need to make a difference.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a class=\"no-underline\" id=\"atg\">Alternative Textbook Grants<\/a><\/h2><a href=\"#top\">Back to top<\/a>\r\n<p>FSU Libraries' <a href=\"\/research-and-publish\/oer\/atg\">Alternative Textbook Grants<\/a> support FSU instructors in replacing commercial textbooks with open educational resources, open textbooks, or library-licensed eResources that are available to students at no cost. FSU Libraries offers ten grants of $1000 to instructors during the 2022-2023 academic year. In some years, additional funding may be available for those publishing new open textbooks.\u00a0Studies show students have similar or increased success and engagement in courses with open materials.
